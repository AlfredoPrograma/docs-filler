# Next-Template by ZenWebApplications

Almost every web application is built using a set of fundamental technologies that are repeatedly configured. While this consistency offers familiarity, it also requires time-consuming setup for each new project.

**Next-Template** by _ZenWebApplications_ is a fine-tuned application starter based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), pre-configured with essential libraries and tools to streamline development.

## üèóÔ∏è Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Ensure you have **[Node.js v22 LTS](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v22.x/api/index.html)** installed.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:Zen-Web-Applications/next-template.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project folder and install dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd next-template
   npm install
   ```
   - If you encounter legacy dependency warnings, run:
     ```sh
     npm install --legacy-peer-deps
     ```
4. Create and configure the environment variables:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file:
     ```sh
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Fill in the necessary values in the `.env` file.
5. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Environment variables are validated at runtime by `core/env.ts`. If validation fails, the application will not run.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Optional Configuration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations

Since this template uses **cutting-edge** technologies, some dependencies may not be fully stable:

- **NextAuth.js** is currently in version `5.0.0-beta.25`.
- **Some ShadCN peer dependencies** do not officially support React v19 yet.

> [!NOTE]
> This template will be updated as stable versions of these libraries are released.
